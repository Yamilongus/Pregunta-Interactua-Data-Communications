Overall Functionality:

Server:
Sends a predefined set of questions to the client sequentially.
Receives and displays client responses in a GUI window.
Terminates the connection upon sending the "FIN" question.
Client:
Connects to the server.
Receives and displays questions from the server.
Provides radio buttons for multiple-choice answers.
Sends selected answers back to the server.
Continues until receiving the "FIN" question.
Key Code Components:

Server:
send_questions_automatically(): Iterates through questions and sends them.
show_response(): Displays answers in the GUI.
Client:
recibir_y_mostrar_pregunta(): Receives and displays questions.
obtener_opciones_pregunta(): Provides answer options based on the question.
responder_pregunta(): Sends the selected answer back to the server.
Code Quality and Potential Improvements:

Clarity and Structure: Both codes are generally well-structured and use functions for clarity.
Data Structures: Consider using more flexible data structures (e.g., dictionaries) to manage questions and answers for features like randomized order or repetition.
GUI: Improve the GUI's visual appeal and interactivity.
Error Handling: Implement error handling for potential issues like connection loss or invalid data.
Security: If used in a public network, consider security measures to protect data transmission.
Additional Considerations:

Dynamic Question Lists: Explore ways to load questions from external sources or create them dynamically.
User Experience: Enhance the user experience with features like progress bars, feedback mechanisms, or personalized question sets.
Testing: Thoroughly test the codes under various conditions to ensure reliability.
Overall:

These codes provide a solid foundation for building a simple client-server system for question-based interactions.
